What is this?
=============

I have become fascinated by the work of Kevin Knuth,
John Skilling, and others on the foundations of probability,
information theory, and physics. However, their writings
are fairly dense and complex, and my understanding is
currently fairly superficial.

The idea of this repository is that I will attempt to
describe their work in ways that are hopefully more
readable for dummies like myself. I might also include
computer demonstrations of some of the ideas.
